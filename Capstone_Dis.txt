Project Steps:
	Clone the project repository
	Explore the code base.
	Fill out ERC721 Mintable Contract in ERC721Mintable.sol
	Write test cases TestERC721Mintable.js
	Compile and pass test cases in TestERC721Mintable.js
	Implement Zokrates
		Using Docker to install and instantiate a Zokrates zkSnarks development environment
		Completes the Zokrates proof in square.code by adding the variable names in square.code
		Compile program
		Trusted setup
		Compute witness
		Generate Proof
		Export Verifier.sol
		Note: 
			This project uses solidity version 0.5.2 so you will be required to update the code in 
			Verifier.sol accordingly based on the compiler errors you receive
	Write a test script to verify the solidity contract generated by Zokrates executed successfully - TestSquareVerifier.js
	Write test contract for ZK and ERC721 integration - SolnSquareVerifier.sol
	Compile and pass with TestSolnSquareVerifier.js
	Deploy latest contracts generated by Zokrates (a.k.a verifier.sol)
	Deploy SolnSquareVerifier contract to Rinkeby network
	Mint 10 tokens
	Generate OpenSea marketplace
	Test and Verify OpenSea with your SolnSquareVerifier tokens
	List 5 of your tokens on the marketplace
	Purchase those 5 tokens using a different address
	Complete required documentation and submit!
